                        .h3.is-size-3 Do we really need another MySQL client?
                        p.has-text-justified
                            |Absolutely! I have been working with MySQL for some time now and have been 
                            |utterly frustrated with the available clients. #[br]
                            |#[a(href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/" target="_blank") Mysql Workbench], the offcial client is atrocious. I dread using it.#[br]
                            |#[a(href="https://dbeaver.io/" target="_blank") DBeaver] is better. But much too clunky for my taste and loaded 
                            |with features which most users don't use on a day-to-day basis.#[br]
                            |#[a(href="https://www.navicat.com/en/" target="_blank") Navicat] is much too expensive and yet it is not all that good.#[br] 
                            |#[a(href="https://www.phpmyadmin.net/" target="_blank") PHPMyAdmin] is decent, but not everyone has PHP or wants to use a PHP based 
                            |application. It is also not known to be very secure.#[br]
                            |There are a few others, but more or less it's the same story.#[br] #[br]
                            |That leaves #[a(href="https://sequelpro.com/" target="_blank") Sequel Pro] ..
                            |I love it! It is so simple, elegant and intuitive. A no-nonsense application like 
                            |every application should be! Alas! It too has some fatal flaws:#[br]
                            ul
                                li No support for MySQL 8.0
                                li Much too unstable. Crashes all the time
                                li Misses out on same basic features like query formatting
                                li Lastly, it works only on Mac
                            |It is safe to say prosql.io is an attempt to match or better Sequel Pro. In fact, the 
                            |name prosql is also inspired by it ;-)

                        .h3.is-size-3 But why a browser app.. why not build a native app?
                        p.has-text-justified
                            |We are in 2021. Computers and Operating Systems were invented decades back. Sadly,
                            |even today there is no painless way of developing cross platform applications.
                            |Browsers are the best way to deliver applications to users across platforms.#[br]
                            |Besides, browsers have a unique advantage: It is very easy to push bug fixes and
                            |new features to users!

                        .h3.is-size-3 Have you really explored all options ..say electron.js?
                        p.has-text-justified
                            |Don't get me started.. #[a(href="https://www.electronjs.org/" target="_blank") electron.js] wraps entire browser and node runtime into every 
                            |application. I shudder at the monstrosity. I don't want users to download 150MB
                            |applications which will use up half their RAM. Too clunky, too bloated, too resource
                            |intensive.#[br]
                            |#[a(href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank") Flutter Desktop] looks interesting..But it is taking forever to get into production #[br]
                            |#[a(href="https://www.qt.io/" target="_blank") QT] has been around, but does not have native look and feel and it was 
                            |not very appetizing to work with QT.

                        .h3.is-size-3 What about Java?
                        p.has-text-justified
                            |Sure! If you like Java language, the look and feel of Java applications and are OK
                            |with users having to download JVM.. Not my cup of tea.

                        .h3.is-size-3 OK, so how does prosql work?
                        p.has-text-justified
                            |Think of it like a web app with your computer as the backend. An agent installed on your
                            |computer talks to the MySQL server and exposes REST APIs to the browser. 
                            |The agent is built in Go and works perfectly on all the major platforms.
                            |It is also very light on resources.

                        .h3.is-size-3 What about performance? Can it match native clients?
                        p.has-text-justified
                            |I have done some benchmarks. The Go client's performance is comparable to official MySQL
                            |C client. So that leaves the overhead of communication with the browsers. This is of the 
                            |order of 10ms per request. Not at all significant. The biggest problem is how to display
                            |thousands of rows in the browser. This is WIP. Eventually I hope to have a performace
                            |comparable to native clients.

                        .h3.is-size-3 Is it secure?
                        p.has-text-justified
                            |The application works if and only if the agent is installed on your computer
                            |and it cannot be accessed remotely. Don't worry! Hackers will not be able to 
                            |access your MySQL server!

                        p.is-size-4
                            |Enough said. Lets get #[a(href="/login") started!]
